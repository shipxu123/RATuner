After routing with this parameter specified, you can\nadd more double-cut vias or larger overhang vias by using\nthe routeDesign command.\n```\n```\nSpecify one of the following:\nlow: Specifies normal routing, so the router uses single-\ncut vias only.\n",

Works in conjunction with\ntiming-driven routing. When timing-driven routing is\nspecified, uses SMART routing to identify victim nets and\nminimize crosstalk by wire spacing, layer hopping, net\nordering, and minimizing the use of long parallel wires.\nWhen timing-driven routing is not specified, uses an older\nsignal integrity engine to minimize crosstalk by preventing\nor reducing the use of long parallel wires.\n\n",

If you specify a file with this command, and also specify\n\nsetNanoRouteMode -timingEngine filename, the router uses the file written out by writeDesignTiming\n\nto drive routing, instead of the timingfile.tif file.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n**Related Information**\n\n```\nsetNanoRouteMode\n```\nfilename Specifies the output filename.\n",
